## Description

This is the GitHub repository for the Community Science Museum website, a project aimed at creating an informative and engaging website for the primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children in our town/city. The goal of this project is to attract both middle school pupils and their parents, providing them with a platform that is not only visually appealing but also educational. The Community Science Museum website serves as an online gateway to the physical museum, enticing visitors to explore the exhibits, and learn about various scientific concepts in an engaging manner. The website is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, ensuring a seamless experience on a variety of devices.
